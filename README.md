# CyCamp - Front-End

I have created a website where you can share bike routes, walk routes and camp area like bikemap. You can share new routes as well as You can comment the existing routes! I was heavily inspired by facebook and instagram while I was creating this website.

## Known Issues and bugs.
On mobile phones some of the there are some error. Unfortunetly it is my first react experience which is I have used react for the first time in my life so I have made some mistakes on routing one page to another. Even though I tried to create responsive design, There are some errors because I didn't use any frameworks or library on some pages or sections. I have tried to provide responsive desing with my own css and html knowledge. I have learned many things about react and css.
