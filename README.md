## Known Issues and bugs.
On mobile phones, there are some error. Unfortunetly it is my first react experience which is I have used react for the first time in my life so I have made some mistakes on routing one page to another. Even though I tried to create responsive design, There are some errors because I didn't use any frameworks or library on some pages or sections. I have tried to provide responsive desing with my own css and html knowledge. I have learned many things about react and css.
